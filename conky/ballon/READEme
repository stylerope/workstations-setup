conky mod by me[for run this conf correctly you have to put  the correct path to your file in the startup.sh and in the rc file.
 conky Music is configurated for exaile music player and you have to install Conkyexaile, 
it is also configurable for other music player but need to correct the line in rc file:
example ${exec conkyExaile --datatype=AR} ---->${exec conkybanshee --datatype=AR}
